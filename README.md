# To-Do List Application

This project is a to-do list application developed with React. It allows users to add, edit, delete, and mark tasks as completed. Additionally, users can filter tasks to display all, completed, or pending items, and sort them alphabetically for better organization and efficiency.

## Features

- **Delete tasks** easily through a delete button.
- **Mark tasks as completed** or revert to not completed.
- **Filter tasks** to display all, only completed, or only pending.
- **Search tasks** by keywords.
- **Sort tasks** alphabetically in ascending or descending order.
- **Data persistence** in `localStorage` to retain tasks after reloading the page.

## Technologies Used
- **React** - JavaScript library for building the interface.
- **CSS3** - Application styling.
- **HTML5** - Project structure.
